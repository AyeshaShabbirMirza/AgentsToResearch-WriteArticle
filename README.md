## Multi-Agent Blog Content Generation with CrewAI

This repository demonstrates how to build a multi-agent system using the CrewAI framework to generate a blog post. The system uses three agents:

- **Content Planner:** Plans the blog content (outline, SEO keywords, target audience).
- **Content Writer:** Writes a detailed blog post based on the plan.
- **Editor:** Proofreads and edits the post for style and accuracy.

## Features

- **Role-Based Collaboration:** Agents with specific roles work together to produce a coherent blog post.
- **Sequential Workflow:** Tasks are executed in order: planning → writing → editing.
- **Customizable Input:** Change the blog topic by providing different inputs.
